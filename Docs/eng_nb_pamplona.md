# Jim's Engineering Journal

## Sprint 1
### Summary
During sprint 1, we got familiar with the project scope and looked into the different technologies associated with the project. We are using Julia for the low-fidelity simulation and Gazebo and ArduPilot for the high-fidelity. As I am on a Mac, I installed a VMware in order to set up the programs needed. I then set up Gazebo and ArduPilot to ensure that they are integrated and are communicating properly. 

## Sprint 2
### 10/1/2024
- VMware broke, so I had to fix the installation and integration of Gazebo and ArduPilot.
- Did research on ways we could make the VMware run Gazebo faster, didn't get anywhere.
- Started new sprint and allocated tasks to everyone.
- Started researching on Julia and how to create python frontend for simulation controls.
### 10/3/2024
- Installed Julia on the VMware (It was really easy, I just had to curl it).
- Did more research on python frontend.
- Reviewed GitHub repo with previous documentation that Alejandro shared.
- Created GitHub engineering journal.
### Summary
Was not able to work due to hurricane and me being at the SASE National Convention. Other members had no power due to the hurricane.

## Sprint 3
### 10/15/2024
- VMware broke again, so I will just install Linux, Ubuntu, and Gazebo on my PC, while working with Julia on Mac.
- Moved all sprint 2 stories and tasks to sprint 3.
- Working on slides to summarize what we have already completed.
### 10/21/2024
